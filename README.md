## My process
After building my markup,
I created a custom class to style the unread notifications at once and also another class to style the read notifications.
then, dynamically remove active status and background color when 'Mark all as read' is click with the help of JavaScript DOM Manipulation
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
-JavaScript DOM Manipulation


### What I learned

```js
  'I learnt about new way of looping through an array, which is "for of loop"ðŸŽ‰'
```

### Continued development


Advance JavaScript DOM manipulation
